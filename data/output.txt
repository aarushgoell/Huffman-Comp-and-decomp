  i would navigate to the HuffmanCoding directory like this:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/HuffmanCoding
Compile and Link Manually:

Run the following command to compile and link your C++ files into an executable. This command assumes you want to place the output binary in a build directory:

bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++17 -o build/huffman_coding src/main.cpp src/HuffmanTree.cpp src/Compression.cpp src/Decompression.cpp
Explanation:

g++: The GNU C++ compiler.
-std=c++17: Specifies that you are using the C++17 standard.
-o build/huffman_coding: Specifies the output file name and path.
src/main.cpp src/HuffmanTree.cpp src/Compression.cpp src/Decompression.cpp: Lists all the source files to compile.
Run Your Executable:

Once compiled, you can run the executable with:

bash
Copy code
./build/huffman_coding
This will execute the program, performing the compression and decompression as defined in main.cpp.

Make sure that the build directory exists before running the compile command. If it does not exist, create it manually or adjust the command to place the output binary in a different directory.

The errors you're seeing are due to the compiler not being able to find the header files in the include directory. You need to tell the compiler where to find these header files by using the -I option to specify the include directory.

Here's how you can modify your compile command to include the path to the header files:

bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++17 -Iinclude -o build/huffman_coding src/main.cpp src/HuffmanTree.cpp src/Compression.cpp src/Decompression.cpp
Explanation:

-Iinclude: This option tells the compiler to look in the include directory for header files.
Steps to Follow:
Open the Terminal in VS Code:

Ensure you have the terminal open as before.
Navigate to Your Project Root Directory:

You should already be in the HuffmanCoding directory, as shown in your previous commands.
Run the Updated Compilation Command:

bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++17 -Iinclude -o build/huffman_coding src/main.cpp src/HuffmanTree.cpp src/Compression.cpp src/Decompression.cpp
Run Your Executable:

After successfully compiling, you can run the program:

bash
Copy code
./build/huffman_coding
Additional Notes:
Ensure that the include directory and the build directory exist in your project root. If the build directory does not exist, you can create it manually or modify the command to output the executable in a different directory.
If you continue to encounter issues, double-check the paths and filenames to ensure there are no typos or discrepancies.

It looks like the compilation command didn't produce any errors this time, which suggests that the files were compiled successfully. If ./build/huffman_coding ran without any output or errors, it's likely that the executable is running correctly, but you might not see any results if there are no print statements or if the program completes without issues.

Here are some things to check and try:

Check if the Executable Exists:
Make sure that build/huffman_coding is indeed created. You can list the files in the build directory:

bash
Copy code
ls build
You should see huffman_coding listed.

Verify Your Program Logic:
Ensure that your main.cpp has code to print out results or confirm that the compression and decompression are taking place. You should see the message "Compression and Decompression completed." if everything is working correctly.

Check for Output Files:
After running the executable, check if data/compressed.bin and data/output.txt have been created or updated. These files should be the results of your program's execution.

Run the Program Directly in PowerShell:
You might need to use .\build\huffman_coding instead of ./build/huffman_coding in PowerShell. Try running:

bash
Copy code
.\build\huffman_coding
Add Debugging Output:
If you're still not seeing any results, consider adding more print statements in your main.cpp to confirm that each step of the process is executed. For example:

cpp
Copy code
std::cout << "Starting Compression..." << std::endl;
// Call compressFile function
std::cout << "Compression Complete." << std::endl;
std::cout << "Starting Decompression..." << std::endl;
// Call decompressFile function
std::cout << "Decompression Complete." << std::endl;
Check for Errors in Execution:
Ensure that input.txt is present in the data/ directory and check if there are any errors during execution that might be preventing file creation.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine whether your program compiled and ran successfully and where any issues might lie.

It looks like huffman_coding.exe was successfully created in the build directory. Here’s what you can do next:

Run the Executable:
Since you’re using PowerShell, you should run the executable with:

powershell
Copy code
.\build\huffman_coding.exe
Verify Output Files:
Check if the output files (data/compressed.bin and data/output.txt) were created or modified after running the executable. You can list the files in the data directory:

powershell
Copy code
ls data
Check for Errors:
If the executable runs without output or errors, ensure that the main.cpp file has code to handle the compression and decompression and print status messages. Add debug messages if necessary to trace the execution flow.

Confirm File Content:
After running the executable, verify the content of the output files to ensure that the compression and decompression processes are working as expected:

Compressed File: Open data/compressed.bin to check if it has binary data.
Decompressed File: Open data/output.txt to verify that it matches the original content of data/input.txt.
If you encounter any specific issues or if the output files are not being created correctly, let me know, and we can troubleshoot further.

It looks like input.txt is present but only has a length of 22 bytes, which is quite small. If the file is too small or empty, it might not provide meaningful results for compression and decompression.

Here’s how to proceed:

Check input.txt Content:
Open input.txt and ensure it contains some text that you want to compress. You can open it in VS Code or use PowerShell:

powershell
Copy code
Get-Content data/input.txt
Verify Program Output:
Run your program again and check the data directory to see if compressed.bin and output.txt are generated.

powershell
Copy code
.\build\huffman_coding.exe
After running, check the contents of the data directory:

powershell
Copy code
ls data
Inspect Output Files:
If compressed.bin and output.txt are created, check their contents:

Compressed File (compressed.bin): Use a binary editor or PowerShell to check if it contains binary data.
Decompressed File (output.txt): Ensure it matches the original content of input.txt.
Debugging:
If the output is not as expected, you may need to add debug prints in your main.cpp or other source files to verify that each step (frequency calculation, tree building, encoding, and decoding) is functioning correctly.

If you have issues with any specific step or file, let me know, and we can work through it together.
